The long-run fraction of time in each state is determined by solving the following system of equations
%$$ \pi_S(q_S) = \pi_L q_{LS} + \pi_H q_{HS}$$
$$ \pi_L(q_L) = \pi_S q_{SL} + \pi_H q_{HL}$$
$$ \pi_H(q_H) = \pi_S q_{SH} + \pi_L q_{LH}$$
$$ \pi_S + \pi_H +\pi_L = 1 .$$

This results in that the long-run fractions of time in the states susceptible, lightly infected and heavily infected are $\pi_S = 0.9233$, $\pi_{I_H} = 0.0185$ and $\pi_{I_L} = 0.0582$. 

On average an individual is infected (either lightly or heavily) 28 days a year, since the long-run fractions of time in the states lightly infected and heavily infected sums to $7.67\%$.
