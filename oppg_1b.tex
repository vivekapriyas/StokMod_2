The long-run mean fractions of time spent in each state can be determined by solving the following system of equations:
%$$ \pi_S(q_S) = \pi_L q_{LS} + \pi_H q_{HS}$$
$$ \pi_{I_L} q_{I_L} = \pi_S q_{S{I_L}} + \pi_{I_H} q_{H{I_L}}$$
$$ \pi_{I_H} q_{I_H} = \pi_S q_{S{I_H}} + \pi_{I_L} q_{{I_L}H}$$
$$ \pi_S + \pi_{I_H} +\pi_{I_L} = 1, $$
where $\pi_i$ is the long-run mean fraction of time spent in state $i$. This results in 
$$\pi_S = 0.9233 \quad \pi_{I_H} = 0.0185 \quad \pi_{I_L} = 0.0582$$

In other words an individual is on average infected, either lightly or heavily, 28 days per year, as the mean fraction of time spent in those states sums to $7.67\%$.
