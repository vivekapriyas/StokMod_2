The graph shows one realization of the continuous-time Markov chain for 5 years.

One can not tell a lot about the generally tendencies from this single realization. 
However, the realization shows that the individual will have two(???) heavy infections and ... light infections within these years. It seems like the proportion of days in each state is corresponding well to the previous result
