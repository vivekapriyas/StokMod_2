Based on one realization of $\{X(t): t \in [0,1000\cdot365]\}$, the long-run mean fraction of time that an individual has an infection is estimated to be $7.62\%$, which corresponds to on average $27.8$ days per year. 

This estimate was found by storing the sums of the sojourn times in each state while simulating the process. After the simulation, the time spent in the infected states was divided by the total simulation time. 

This seems to be a reasonable estimate compared to the result from \textbf{b)} where the long-run mean fraction of time spent in either of the infected states was found to be $7.67\%$ or $27.97$ days a year on average.
