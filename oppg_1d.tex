The long-run mean fraction of time that an individual has an infection is estimated to be $7.62\%$, i.e. 27.80 days a year.  

HOW WE CALCULATED THIS ESTIMATE.

To calculate this estimate we stored the time spent in the different states during the simulation. After the simulation we computed time spent in infected states divided by the total simulation time. 

Compared to the result from b), namely that an individual is infected $7.67\%$ of the time  (27.97 days a year), the estimate seems reasonable.
