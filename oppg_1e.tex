To calculate the expected time between two heavy infections is the same as calculating the expected time to become heavily infected in general starting in state susceptible. This since an individual immediately after a heavy infection  has to be susceptible and the sojourn times are exponential distributed / memoryless. 

We define $v_i = E[\text{min}\{t \geq 0: X(t) = I_H | X(0) = i\}]$ for $i = I_S, I_L, I_H$. We solve the following system of equations
$$v_{I_H} = 0$$
$$V_{S} = E[S_S] + P(S \rightarrow I_L) v_{I_L}+ P(S \rightarrow I_) v_{I_H} $$
$$V_{I_L} = E[S_{I_L}] + P(I_L \rightarrow S) v_S + P(I_L \rightarrow I_H) v_{I_H} $$


$$ v_{S} = \frac{1}{\lambda} + (1-\alpha) v_{I_L} $$
$$ v_{I_L} =  \frac{1}{\mu_{I_L}}+  \frac{1}{\lambda} + (1-\alpha) v_{I_L} $$

$$ v_{I_L} =  \frac{\frac{1}{\mu_{I_L}} +  \frac{1}{\lambda}}{\alpha} = 1070 \text{ days}$$
$$ v_S =  \frac{1}{\lambda} + \frac{ (1-\alpha)(\frac{1}{\mu_{I_L}} +  \frac{1}{\lambda})}{\alpha} = 1063 \text{ days} $$. 

The expected time between heavy infections is calculated to by $v_S = 1063 \text{ days} \approx 2.9 \text{ years.}$
