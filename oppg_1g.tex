We use Little's law and define L as the hospitals capacity to handle individuals with complications from a cold, $\lambda_h$ as the mean number of individuals that requires hospitalization, and $W$ as the average treatment time required so that the average number of individuals does not exceed the capacity. 

Using Little's law, 
$$L = \lambda_h W$$

Solves the following system of equations
$$ \pi_S \lambda = \pi_I \mu$$ 
$$ \pi_S + \pi_I = 1 $$

$$\pi_S = \frac{\mu}{\lambda + \mu} $$
$$ \pi_I = \frac{\lamba}{\lambda+\mu} $$


The average number of susceptible individuals is then 
$$ 5.26 \text{ mill.} \frac{\mu}{\lambda + \mu} = 4.91 \text{ million individuals.}$$

Meaning that $\lambda 4.91 \text{ mill.} = 49158 \text{ individuals}$ on average gets infected on a given day. 

This makes the arrivalrate of individuals that requires hospitalization that day
$$\lambda_h = 491.6$$. 

The average treatment time required so that the average number of individuals in the hospital does not exceed the capacity is determined to be $4.068$ days.
