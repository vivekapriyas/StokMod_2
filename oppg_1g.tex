We use Little's law and define $L$ as the hospitals capacity to handle individuals with complications from a cold, $\lambda_h$ as the mean number of individuals that requires hospitalization, and $W$ as the average treatment time required so that the average number of individuals does not exceed the capacity. 

One calculate the long-run fraction of time an individual is susceptible by solving the following set of equations
$$ \pi_S \lambda = \pi_I \mu$$ 
$$ \pi_S + \pi_I = 1 $$

$$ \pi_S = \frac{\mu}{\lambda + \mu} = \frac{100}{107} = 0.935$$.
%$$ \pi_I = \frac{\lambda}{\lambda+\mu} $$

The average number of susceptible individuals is then 
$$ 5.26  \pi_S = 5.26 \cdot \frac{100}{107} = 4.9159 \text{ million individuals.}$$

This makes the average number of individuals getting infected on a given day $ 49159$ individuals, i.e. one hundredth of the susceptible individuals.

The arrivalrate of individuals that requires hospitalization a given day is then one percent of the average number of individuals getting infected that day, i.e. $\lambda_h = 491.6$ individuals. 

The average treatment time required so that the average number of individuals in the hospital does not exceed the capacity is determined to be $4.068$ days, using Little's law $W = \lambda_h/L$ with $L = 2000$ and $\lambda_h = 491.59$.
